# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study
Case Study on estimating demand for Bikes based on Date and Weather factors 

This programming assignment involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for a US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes. The company aims to develop a strategic business plan to recover from the revenue decline caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The assignment requires creating a Jupyter notebook to analyze a dataset containing daily bike demands in the American market based on various factors.

The problem statement emphasizes the importance of identifying significant variables that influence bike demand and assessing how well these variables explain the fluctuations in demand. BoomBikes has contracted a consulting company to investigate the factors affecting bike demand and wants to achieve specific goals:

- Identify significant variables predicting bike demand.
- Evaluate how well these variables describe the variations in bike demand.

The company has collected a comprehensive dataset through meteorological surveys and lifestyle factors, providing insights into daily bike demands. The ultimate business goal is to model bike demand based on independent variables, enabling the management to understand demand variations and adjust business strategies accordingly. The resulting model will serve as a valuable tool for understanding demand dynamics in the American market post-quarantine and guide the company's efforts to meet customer expectations and maximize profits.
